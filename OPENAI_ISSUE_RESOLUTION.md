# OpenAI API Key Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary

The user reported having a "correct API key" but was getting authentication errors from OpenAI. The error logs showed:

```
OpenAI API error: Unauthorized - {
    "error": {
        "message": "Incorrect API key provided: sk-proj-**************************************************************LgwA",
        "type": "invalid_request_error",
        "param": null,
        "code": "invalid_api_key"
    }
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **The configuration system was working correctly** - the API key was being found and loaded
2. **The API key format was valid** - it starts with `sk-proj-` which is a project-scoped OpenAI API key
3. **OpenAI was rejecting the key** - despite appearing valid, the API returned 401 Unauthorized
4. **Limited error handling** - the application didn't provide specific guidance for project-scoped key issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced API Key Validation
- **Before**: Only recognized traditional `sk-` prefixed keys
- **After**: Recognizes both `sk-` and `sk-proj-` prefixed keys
- **Impact**: Proper validation for modern OpenAI API key formats

### 2. Improved Error Messages
- **Before**: Generic "authentication failed" messages
- **After**: Detailed troubleshooting guidance including:
  - API key format verification
  - Project permissions checking (for `sk-proj-` keys)
  - Model access verification
  - Billing status checks
  - Direct links to OpenAI platform

### 3. Better Configuration Validation
- **Before**: Startup validation might miss project-scoped keys
- **After**: Recognizes all valid API key formats with appropriate warnings

### 4. Enhanced Documentation
- **Before**: Limited guidance on API key configuration
- **After**: Comprehensive documentation covering:
  - Different API key types
  - Project-scoped key specifics
  - Troubleshooting steps
  - Configuration methods

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `TestCaseAgent.Server/Services/OpenAIService.cs`
   - Updated `IsValidApiKeyFormat()` to support `sk-proj-` keys
   - Added `BuildUnauthorizedErrorMessage()` for detailed error guidance
   - Enhanced constructor logging for project-scoped keys

2. `TestCaseAgent.Server/Services/ConfigurationValidationService.cs`
   - Updated validation to recognize project-scoped API keys
   - Improved error messages with modern key format information

3. `OPENAI_SETUP.md`
   - Added section on API key types
   - Enhanced troubleshooting for project-scoped keys
   - Updated configuration examples

## Testing

- ✅ API key validation logic tested for both key types
- ✅ Build verification passed
- ✅ Configuration validation shows improved messages
- ✅ Documentation updated with current OpenAI standards

## User Action Required

The user should verify their project-scoped API key by:

1. **Checking key status**: Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
2. **Verifying project access**: Ensure the project has access to `gpt-4o-mini` model
3. **Checking billing**: Confirm account has sufficient credits
4. **Testing directly**: Use OpenAI Playground to verify the key works

## Expected Outcome

With these improvements, users will now receive:
- ✅ Clear identification of project-scoped API keys
- ✅ Specific troubleshooting guidance when keys are rejected
- ✅ Better fallback behavior when OpenAI is unavailable
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for all scenarios

The application will continue to work with both traditional and project-scoped OpenAI API keys, providing better error messages and guidance when issues occur.
